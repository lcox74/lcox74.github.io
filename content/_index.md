## Previous Quests

- **[Hyperion Technology](https://hyperiontechnology.com.au/)** - Senior 
    Developer (2023-2024). Wrote management systems for embedded on-site 
    hardware. Spent most of my time reverse engineering devices that 
    absolutely did not work the way the retailer promised, so I bypassed their 
    drivers entirely and talked to the hardware directly.

- **National Advice Solutions** - Developer (2019-2022). Solo dev building web 
    applications, Salesforce Lightning Web Components, and automating 
    processes for financial advisers. Also did more data migrations than any 
    one person should have to.

- **[Interactive](https://www.interactive.com.au/)** - Automation 
    Engineer (2019-2020). Built a portal from scratch for provisioning epipes 
    via Nokia NSP and NFM-P. 

## Side Quests

- **[Blog](/blog)** - Software, self-hosting, and things I got nerd-sniped by
- **Coffee** - Reviews from someone who drinks too much of it (coming soon)
- **Drinks** - Beer, wine, and spirits. Mostly beer. (coming soon)

## Idle Animations

When not writing code or breaking things: rewatching old episodes of Top Gear, 
watching my sports teams get thrashed, or pretending I'll finally fix my 
*arr stack.
