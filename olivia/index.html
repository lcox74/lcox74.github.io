understatement because there are no words I have that can describe how much I
love you, or how much you mean to me. Every time I try to write these I never
feel that I have truly expressed my love for you. You are the love of my life,
even though you are in a different state my mind still plays tricks on me make
it feel like you are actually here with me. Sometimes these feelings are nice
but others are mean, for example rolling over when I'm a sleep and scare waking
myself up worried that I might have accidently slapped you in the face (this is
on of the mean ones). Other times when I successfully do something at work or
anywhere I can imaging hearing you say <code>Good job baby</code> before kissing me on
the cheek.</p> <p>Anyway lets get back on topic, lets reminisce.</p> <h2 id="_2018"><a href="#_2018" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2018</h2> <p>March-April 2018, the month I decided to message you to see how you were going.
I have no idea why I decided to, but it was one of the biggest highlights in my
life. Without this single thing happening we wouldn't be together now (maybe, I
don't know). I occasionally think back to the first couple of weeks we and how
weird I was, and how shy you were. It was adorable. I'm so lucky that my
craziness didn't drive you away. Remember how you didn't want to do long
distance yet I was able to convince you, do you regret it? XD. I don't.</p> <p>I believe from memory you said yes on the <code>10th April 2018</code>. We counted months
we were together for a couple months after this date, now we are only couting
years. But in all honesty, it's felt like there wasn't a time we weren't
together. We video called everyday and ingrained each other into our daily lives
and into each others families. The first time we physically saw each other was
up here, you stayed with your Auntie and I had to come pick you up and take you
places to go on dates. The second physical time was when I went to Melbourne for
my birthday. I spent my 18th birthday night wishing I was withyou but instead I
arrived late, when everything was closing and I had a pretty bad/boring night
with Nana &amp; Pa. But the following day we got to have dinner together at
<code>Big Pig Little Pig</code> along with Andrea, Nana and Pa. That was a goodnight,
being able to spend time with each other. The rest of the trip was a blur. The
next visit I stayed at you place, and it wasn't much later when we finally
got to sleep with each other.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/bed.802de985.jpg" alt="Bed"></p> <p>I also remember when you were the one with the medical problems, you have me
some really good frights while you were at it. Man have the times changed with
that. But I'm glad I'm the one that has to deal with the physical pain instead
of you as that was the main thing I wish I could have taken away from you during
your painful times.</p> <blockquote><p>Quick note, our bucket list was first created on May 8th, 2018</p></blockquote> <h3 id="valedictory"><a href="#valedictory" class="header-anchor">#</a> Valedictory</h3> <p>I remember your Val, it was when you kept telling me to bugger off when you were
getting your make up done. But before that I got to watch your graduation in
person and meet your highschool friends, oh and teachers. I can never remember
the grad video song off the top of my head. But everytime I hear it in the
office I always remember you grad when I do.</p> <p>I think the Valedictory night was probably when I first started getting symptoms
of my UC. Which does explain how I was feeling that night, but anyway it was a
fun night.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/val.e9ac8dc7.jpg" alt="Val"></p> <h3 id="noosa"><a href="#noosa" class="header-anchor">#</a> Noosa</h3> <p>Remember Noosa, we had a great time together there. We were sleeping in seperate
rooms at the start but ended up moving together after some convincing to
Claudia. I remember getting you the Bikini that you still have today with you. I
remember all the Ben and Jerries we had together as well. Trying to teach you to
surf. Proving my phone had a better camera. Casual walks we did, and some other
new things. Oh yeah and also this...</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/young.0ca00ee5.jpg" alt="Young"> <img src="/assets/img/old.585738ed.jpg" alt="Old"></p> <h2 id="_2019"><a href="#_2019" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2019</h2> <p>This year was a hard year for me medically and you mentally. We both started uni
but me constantly getting dicked around at hospitals and put through many
medications was difficult. But we got through it, a year of hell that had a
sequal in <code>2020</code>.</p> <p>The good thing was that we got to see each other the most this year. We did have
our fair share of fun and do a whole bunch of stuff. You also got to meet my
friends this year, we went and saw a movie at Robina all together.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/sushi.1acd75aa.jpg" alt="Sushi"></p> <p>There was also a lot of shenanigans as you were apart of my friend group chat.
Oh and taking the piss out of Nat and Gordie.</p> <h3 id="olivia-s-18th"><a href="#olivia-s-18th" class="header-anchor">#</a> Olivia's 18th</h3> <p>You had your 18th this year and I was able to spend it with you, I might have
given you too much to drink. Lots of vodka, lemonade, tequila. I still remember
having to hose out the pavement after you hurled all over. It was adorable, I
made sure I took care of you and got you to bed safely and introduced you to the
holy bucket, may it be our saviour and protector forever.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/birthday.a743c023.jpg" alt="Birthday"></p> <h3 id="wedding"><a href="#wedding" class="header-anchor">#</a> Wedding</h3> <p>No unfortunately it wasn't ours. But it was Karen and Steve's. You stayed with
me and we met your parents there. You slept in the car on the drive there. I
met most of your family here, it was alot of fun and we ended up staying at a
hotel with your parents before going home. Oh yeah remember when the hair
dresser screwed up doing you hair, good fun. You look really good in curls.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/karensteve.982095b5.jpg" alt="Wedding"></p> <p>Later in this trip our families met together at the CBD for the first time. And
we tried going clubbing in Burliegh which went didn't go too well and was
another night of me looking after you.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/firstfamilyqld.d5f4d163.jpg" alt="Families"></p> <h3 id="funeral"><a href="#funeral" class="header-anchor">#</a> Funeral</h3> <p>I was really contemplating putting this in here, but our history main big events
wouldn't be complete without this. This was a hard time for you and your family
along with my by extension. I really connected with your family during this
time, it's also probably one of the reasons that I have been put in the good
books all round in your family. Plus I was glad that I was able to physically be
there with you during this really really hard time.</p> <h3 id="christmas-new-years"><a href="#christmas-new-years" class="header-anchor">#</a> Christmas &amp; New Years</h3> <p>I got to spend the end of Christmas alone with you which was fantastic. We also
followed up with new years during a dangerous time of big wild fires. But we
managed to do pretty well. We drank alot then. So did everyone else. But it was
a good night. Oh and there was bowling somewhere around here as well.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/newyears.71f6f218.jpg" alt="NewYears"></p> <h2 id="_2020"><a href="#_2020" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2020</h2> <p>This was a hard year, but at least we made the most of it with you here for
Christmas and New Years. But the biggest highlight was definitely the Japan
Trip. Oh and I also made it to your birthday which was a huge bonus.</p> <h3 id="japan"><a href="#japan" class="header-anchor">#</a> Japan</h3> <p>This was our first ever trip just together, and it wasn't a little trip. This
time was something special. Exploring exotic places in Tokyo before going to
Nozawa and experiencing the easten life during winter. Skiing with you was fun
but I also just liked being with you and chilling in the landscape. Oh and the
snow monkeys.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/snow.eb285afe.jpg" alt="snow"></p> <p>This was an amazing experience to have with you, and one of the bonuses was that
we didn't rip each others heads off. Thats gotta be a couples milestone
somewhere.</p> <h3 id="disneyland"><a href="#disneyland" class="header-anchor">#</a> Disneyland</h3> <p>No I didn't forget about this, being able to bring you to a place you always
dreamed about going to was a joy in its self. We did alot of walking this day,
went on a bunch of rides and even &quot;scary&quot; rides as well. There was also a lot of
not understanding what the fuck everyone was saying, but that be semantics. Also
we might need to go to another one thats english so the language barier isn't
so heavy.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/disney.32affa8f.jpg" alt="disney"></p> <h3 id="olivia-s-19th"><a href="#olivia-s-19th" class="header-anchor">#</a> Olivia's 19th</h3> <p>It was good to be able to spend time with you and enjoy celerbrating your 19th
birthday. Especially before the massive event of covid happening. We were really
lucky with this one, I just regret that I wasn't able to spend as much time with
you on this trip before the big gap.</p> <h3 id="christmas"><a href="#christmas" class="header-anchor">#</a> Christmas</h3> <p>It had been over 8 months of us being apart. But we were able to catch up as
though we were never apart. Even though there was a bit of awkwardness of being
tired, always on our phones as physically being together again just felt strange
after being a virtual image for the longest period of time we have ever been
apart. But we made it and my love of you has done nothing but sky rocket. I
heavily envy Max as he gets to spend so much time with you as you probably do
when I see other people. It must have been really weird spending Christmas not
with your family but with mine, and then chilling out all day at Frodos. Very
atypical. But it was fititng for just an atypical and bizare year.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/frodo.02ab0a6f.jpg" alt="frodo"></p> <p>You have been an amazing person to be with, there is no one else in the world
who is as fantastic and wonderful as you. I easily get lost staring at your face
after hard days. I can't wait to spend more of my life with you and eventually
start our very own family. My love is with you always, and I will support you
with anything, I will do what ever I can to help you through hard times. You are
the love of my life and you are my future.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/liv.58e0a4a6.jpg" alt="liv"></p> <h2 id="_2021"><a href="#_2021" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2021</h2> <blockquote><p>To be continued, let's see where our next adventure takes us.</p></blockquote></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
